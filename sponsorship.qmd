Please see below for Sponsorship opportunities. Note that your donations are tax-deductible.

Please [contact us](mailto:alexander.fisher@duke.edu) if you are interested in sponsorship and/or have any questions.

### Impact of Your Sponsorship

Your sponsorship of ASA DataFest<small><sup>TM</sup></small> benefits the ASA DataFest<small><sup>TM</sup></small> @ Duke. Any residual funds will support undergraduate statistics education, foster the new generation of data science, and advance our mission of promoting the use of data in the understanding of our environment, our social relationships, and our physical and virtual selves.

### Benefits of Sponsorship

Sponsors will be provided with various advertising and recruiting opportunities. But equally important is your time! Please consider visiting us as a "VIP Consultant". Drop by for a couple of hours and talk to the teams to point them in the right direction. It's a wonderful recruiting opportunity and lots of fun, too. We ask that visitors sign up for a time slot so that we'll know when to expect you, but we won't hold you to it.
