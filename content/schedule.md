<b>March 11 update:</b>
<br>

Duke Univesity has suspended all campus events with over 50 attendees until April 20 (see the <a href = "https://president.duke.edu/2020/03/10/urgent-message-regarding-covid-19/">March 10 statement from President Price</a>). Therefore, we are no longer holding DataFest 2020 at Penn Pavilion. We are currently working with the national DataFest committee to plan a virtual alternative for this year's event. We'll continue to update the website as more informaiton becomes available. Please email Maria Tackett at <a href = "mailto:maria.tackett@duke.edu">maria.tackett@duke.edu</a> if you have any questions.
