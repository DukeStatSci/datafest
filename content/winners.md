Thank you to everyone who participated in DataFest 2021 @ Duke! Each project provided a unique and interesting insight into
patterns of drug use and misuse based on survey data provided by the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety Center. The projects were judged by 22
professionals from academia and industry in statistics, data science,
and related fields. They were scored based on the creativity and accuracy of the analysis, insights and ethical considerations in the conclusions, and presentation of results.

Congratulations to all of this year's winners!
