R and the Tidyverse are a data-first coding language that enables reproducible workflows. Attendees will learn the fundamentals of R, the Tidyverse, how to wrangle data for analysis, and practice reporting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with R Markdown.

Part 1 has no prerequisites although you will want to download and install R and RStudio (details will be sent a week in advance.) By the end of the workshop you will import data, edit and save scripts, subset data, use projects to organize your work, and develop self-help techniques.

In this workshop we will focus on ggplot2, a library for R that creates clear and well-designed visualizations and that plays well with other tidyverse packages. Attendees will get up and running quickly with ggplot2, going through a variety of examples to learn how to understand, modify, and create ggplot2 visualizations. Building basic skills with visualization will improve your ability to create quick, exploratory visualizations for data analysis as well as more formal, outward-facing visualizations for presentations or publications.

While prior experience with ggplot2 and with other tidyverse packages is not required, some basic familiarity with R is expected.  Please consider attending an Introduction to R workshop (or reviewing online learning materials) before attending this workshop on ggplot2. In this workshop, we will use RStudio and RMarkdown files for all exercises.

### <i class="fas fa-code" style="color:#0E3A53"></i> Intro to Geospatial Data

| <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>        | &nbsp; 6:30p - 8:30p   |


This workshop provides an introduction to the foundational concepts behind geospatial data—data that includes location information. We will focus on the special characteristics of geospatial data that differ from other types of data, and explore how these differences affect visualization, processing, and analysis. Participants will also learn about data types, methods for finding data, and commonly used tools for working with geospatial data.

### <i class="fas fa-code" style="color:#0E3A53"></i> Intro to Tableau: Easy charts and maps

by Eric Monson

Tableau Public (available for both Windows and Mac) is incredibly useful free software that allows individuals to quickly and easily explore their data with a wide variety of visual representations, as well as create interactive web-based visualization dashboards. This workshop will focus on using Tableau Public to create data visualizations, starting with an overview of how the program thinks about data, common data manipulation and loading, and the terminology used. Activities will include a sample data visualization and mapping project, which will give people hands-on experience using Tableau’s basic chart types and dashboard creation tools. We will also discuss publishing to the Tableau Public web server and related services and tools, like the full Tableau Desktop application (free for full-time students).

This workshop is designed for beginners who might be comfortable with data and spreadsheets, but have no experience with Tableau, are curious about what it can do, and want to get a quick introduction so they can start playing on their own.

### <i class="fas fa-code" style="color:#0E3A53"></i> Presenting Data Science Results to Stakeholders

by Angela Zoss

|                                     |             |
| ------------------------------------|-------------|

| <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>        | &nbsp; 7p - 8p   |

This presentation will focus on strategies for developing a short presentation that summarizes a data science project, including: identifying a compelling story in the analysis; leading with the key takeaways; and presenting results simply, effectively, and visually. Communicating with stakeholders is a core process in any data science project. Attendees will learn to construct a visually effective and time-efficient presentation for sharing data science results with your stakeholders to maximize the time you have with them.

NOTE:  This is not a hands-on workshop. No special software is required, other than Zoom.


### <i class="fas fa-code" style="color:#0E3A53"></i> Slides with R Markdown: Xaringan

by John Little

| <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>        | &nbsp; 6:30p - 8:30p |

 R markdown is a means of applying structure to the prose in your coding document.  Using R Markdown and the xaringan package, attendees will integrate code with natural language (i.e. prose) to render presentation slides as a reproducible report.  The method of integrating code with prose is known as literate coding.  Attendees will focus their energies on rendering slides as one type of report while being introduced to an array of report types that can be generated from the same code.
