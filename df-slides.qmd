## Data distribution {.smaller}

Two methods:

1.  If using the RStudio/Jupyter containers, data will appear magically for you, find credentials to log-in at check-in counter!

2.  If not, download from the link pinned in slack (link will only be available for a short time after kickoff)

-   **Read the proprietary statement!**
-   Data can only be used for DataFest and should not be shared with anyone outside of DataFest or posted publicly
-   Advice: Working with large data can be tricky, if you don't have your own tricks up your sleeves, ask/look for advice on working with large data

## Rules + recommendations

-   Do not post the data or the data source publicly
-   Wear your name badge at all times
-   Stick around the premises --- that's where help, food, raffle prizes, and each others' company is!

## wifi

-   If Duke, use what you usually use
-   `DukeVisitor` works otherwise
